Disease Diagnosis System

Through AI developments, machines are now given power and intelligence to behave and work like human mind. In this project, we try to propose and implement an AI based health physician system that would be able to interact with the patient, do the diagnosis and suggest quick remedy or treatment of their problem or recommend a doctor. 

A decision tree algorithm is implemented in order to follow a top down searching approach to identify and diagnose the problem and suggest a possible solution. The system uses a questionnaire-based approach to query the user (patient) about various Symptoms, based on which a decision is made and a medicine or doctor is recommended based on the severity.
